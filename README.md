Note taker

this application is meant to store information that the user does not want to forget or things that they want to keep track of. Issue i had with this was getting the notes to show up and save along with having some issues involing the style and javascript. if you would like to use this application you would first need to create a folder on your local computer then which you want to clone down the repo after which you will use npm install then do npm install express once your do that to get the server up and runnning you want to type the command npm start in the command line and open the link localHost3001.
